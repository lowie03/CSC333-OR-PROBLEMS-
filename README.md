CSC 333: Linear Programming Solutions
Description
This repository contains solutions to the Linear Programming (LP) problems provided in the CSC 333 Lab Assignment 1. The assignment explores solving LP problems graphically and programmatically using Python, showcasing both hand-drawn solutions and computational methods.

Objectives
Solve LP problems graphically by hand and visualize the solutions.
Use Python to graphically solve LP problems by plotting constraints, identifying feasible regions, and determining the optimal solutions.
Share the results and methodology through a GitHub repository.
Repository Contents
Hand-Solved Solutions: Scanned PDFs or images of the graphical solutions showing constraints, feasible regions, and optimal solutions.
Python Code: Scripts written in Python (e.g., lp_graphical_solution.py) that use libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and scipy (or pulp) to solve the LP problems graphically.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository, the steps involved in solving the problems, and instructions for running the Python code.
Results: Outputs from the Python scripts, including plots showing the feasible regions and optimal points.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python (>=3.8)
Python libraries: matplotlib, numpy, scipy, or pulp
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running scripts interactively)
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Eblazecode/CSC333-OR-Linear-Programming-Solutions.git
cd CSC333-OR-Linear-Programming-Solutions
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy pulp
Running the Python Code
Navigate to the Python script directory.
Run the script in the terminal or use Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
python lp_graphical_solution.py
Viewing Results
The script will display plots for each LP problem, showing constraints, the feasible region, corner points, and the optimal solution.
Refer to the results/ directory for saved plots and output files.
Methodology
Hand-Solved Solutions
Graph the constraints for each problem on graph paper.
Identify and shade the feasible region.
Mark the corner points of the feasible region.
Calculate the optimal solution by evaluating the objective function at each corner point.
Python Graphical Solution
Define the constraints and the objective function.
Use matplotlib to graph the constraints.
Shade the feasible region programmatically.
Use scipy or pulp to identify and validate the optimal solution.
Plot the solution on the graph.
